                        <p class="block">Welcome to my portfolio. I'm an information technology instructor based in Northern Minnesota.</p>
                        <p class="block">I have almost 20 years experience in education and 12 in higher education. I have taught every subject, but my particular specialty is information technology and computer science. I currently teach at Leech Lake Tribal College, a small community college and up-and-coming research institution situated right inside the Chippewa National Forest. There I work on projects related to education, forest ecology, drone imaging, data processing, and virtual reality. I teach computer application and computer programming courses.</p>
                        <p class="block">Occasionally, I will work as a contractor. I worked to develop a web-based lending library for a regional educational co-op, for efficient allocation of adaptive equipment for students with special needs in several school districts.</p>
                        <p class="block">I am extremely well-read, have fantastic written and verbal communication skills.</p>
                        <p class="block">I have experience with every aspect of software development and many platforms and frameworks. I consider myself a life-long learner, am flexible and eager to learn about any new tech.</p>
